First you need 3 things.

        1.) press ctrl + alt + t
        2.) copy the content within quotes and paste it into your terminal. "sudo apt-get install python"
        3.) enter your password when prompted

        1.) In your terminal, type in "sudo apt-get install python-pygame" and follow the prompts.

In order to run:
